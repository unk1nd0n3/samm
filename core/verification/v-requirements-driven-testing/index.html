<h2 id="maturity-1-test-for-software-security-controls">Maturity 1 - Test for software security controls</h2>

<h3 id="activity">Activity</h3>

<p>Conduct security tests to verify that the standard software security controls operate as expected. At a high level, this means testing the correct functioning of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability controls of the data as well as the service. Security test cases should at least include testing for authentication, access control, input validation, encoding and escaping data and encryption controls. The test objective is to validate that the security controls are implemented with few or no vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>The security testing should test for software security controls that are relevant for the software under test. The control verification security tests can be performed manually or with tools and should be performed each time the applications use of the controls is changed. Software control verification should be considered mandatory for all software that is part of the SAMM program. The tests should be regularly reviewed, to include changes in the software technology, and vulnerability trends.</p>

<h2 id="maturity-2-derive-test-cases-from-known-security-requirements">Maturity 2 - Derive test cases from known security requirements</h2>

<h3 id="activity-1">Activity</h3>

<p>From the known security requirements, identify and implement a set of security test cases to check the software for correct functionality. To have a successful testing program, one must know what the testing objectives are. These objectives are specified by the security requirements.</p>

<p>Security test cases should be derived for the applications in scope from the security requirements that were created as part of the SAMM security practice &ldquo;Security Requirements&rdquo;. In order to validate security requirements with security tests, security requirements need to be function driven and they need to highlight the expected functionality (the what) and implicitly the implementation (the how). These requirements are also referred to as “positive requirements”, since they state the expected functionality that can be validated through security tests. Examples of positive requirements are: “the application will lockout the user after six failed log on attempts” or “passwords need to be a minimum of six alphanumeric characters”. The validation of positive requirements consists of asserting the expected functionality and can be tested by re-creating the testing conditions and running the test according to predefined inputs. The results are then shown as as a fail or pass condition.</p>

<p>Often, it is most effective to use the project team’s time to build application-specific test cases and utilize publicly available resources or purchased knowledge bases to select applicable general test cases for security. Candidate test cases should be reviewed for applicability, efficacy, and feasibility by relevant development, security, and quality assurance staff. Deriving the test cases should occur during the requirements and/or design phase of the functionality. Testing the security requirements should be part of the functional testing of the software.</p>

<h2 id="maturity-3-perform-regression-testing-with-security-unit-tests">Maturity 3 - Perform regression testing (with security unit tests)</h2>

<h3 id="activity-2">Activity</h3>

<p>Write and automate regression tests for all identified (and fixed) bugs to ensures that these specific bugs will not occur again. Security unit tests should verify dynamically (i.e., at run time) that the components function as expected and should validate that code changes are properly implemented.</p>

<p>A good practice for developers is to build security test cases as a generic security test suite that is part of the existing unit testing framework.vA generic security test suite might include security test cases to validate both positive and negative requirements for security controls such as: Identity, Authentication &amp; Access Control, Input Validation &amp; Encoding, User and Session Management, Error and Exception Handling, Encryption and Auditing and Logging.</p>

<p>Unit test frameworks such as Junit, Nunit, and CUnit can be adapted to verify security test requirements. In the case of security functional tests, unit level tests can test the functionality of security controls at the software component level, such as functions, methods, or classes. For example, a test case could validate input and output validation (e.g., variable sanitation) and boundary checks for variables by asserting the expected functionality of the component.</p>

<h2 id="maturity-1-perform-security-fuzzing-testing">Maturity 1 - Perform security fuzzing testing</h2>

<h3 id="activity-3">Activity</h3>

<p>Fuzzing can be part of a manual of automated security test, but this activity should cover at a minimum fuzzing for vulnerabilities against the main input parameters of the application.</p>

<p>Perform fuzzing, sending massive amounts of random data, to the test subject in an attempt to make it crash. Fuzz testing or Fuzzing is a Black Box software testing technique, which basically consists in finding implementation bugs using malformed/semi-malformed data injection in an automated fashion.</p>

<p>The great advantage of fuzz testing is that the test design is extremely simple, and free of preconceptions about system behavior. The systematical/random approach allows this method to find bugs that would have often been missed by human eyes. Plus, when the tested system is totally closed (say, a SIP phone), fuzzing is one of the only means of reviewing it&rsquo;s quality.</p>

<p>Consider the use of automated fuzing tools and build an application specific dictionary of fuzzing payloads like fault injection patterns, predictable resource locations, and regexes for matching server responses (you can start with open source dictionaries like FuzzDB*)</p>

<h2 id="maturity-2-create-and-test-abuse-cases-and-business-logic-flaw-test">Maturity 2 - Create and test abuse cases and business logic flaw test</h2>

<h3 id="activity-4">Activity</h3>

<p>Similar to use cases, misuse and abuse cases [19] describe unintended and malicious use scenarios of the application. These misuse cases provide a way to describe scenarios of how an attacker could misuse and abuse the application. Create misuse and abuse cases to misuse or exploit the weaknesses of controls in software features to attack an application. Include at least one abuse case for every positive test case that is part of the unit tests. Use abuse-case models for an application to serve as fuel for identification of concrete security tests that directly or indirectly exploit the abuse scenarios.</p>

<p>Abuse of functionality, sometimes referred to as a &ldquo;business logic attack&rdquo;, depends on the design and implementation for application functions and features. As functionality is added to applications, thought must be given to how the function or feature can be manipulated to circumvent the business process, or abused to perform a function not intended by the developer. An example may be: Using a password reset flow to enumerate accounts. As part of business logic testing, identify the business rules that are important for the application and turn them into experiments designed to verify whether the application properly enforces the business rule. For example, on a stock trading application is the attacker allowed to start a trade at the beginning of the day and lock in a price, hold the transaction open until the end of the day, then complete the sale if the stock price has risen or cancel out if the price dropped.</p>

<p>While there are tools for testing and verifying that business processes are functioning correctly in valid situations these tools are incapable of detecting logical vulnerabilities. For example, tools have no means of detecting if a user is able to circumvent the business process flow through editing parameters, predicting resource names or escalating privileges to access restricted resources nor do they have any mechanism to help the human testers to suspect this state of affairs.</p>

<h2 id="maturity-3-denial-of-service-and-security-stress-testing">Maturity 3 - Denial of service and security stress testing</h2>

<h3 id="activity-5">Activity</h3>

<p>Applications are particularly susceptible to denial of service attacks. Perform denial of service and security stress testing against the applications. These tests are performed under controlled circumstances and possibly on application acceptance environments.</p>

<p>Load testing tools, such as JMeter can generate web traffic so that you can test certain aspects of how your site performs under heavy load. Certainly one important test is how many requests per second your application can field. Testing from a single IP address is useful as it will give you an idea of how many requests an attacker will have to generate in order to damage your site.To determine if any resources can be used to create a denial of service, you should analyze each one to see if there is a way to exhaust it. You should particularly focus on what an unauthenticated user can do, but unless you trust all of your users, you should examine what an authenticated user can do as well.</p>

<p>Denial of service tests can include tests that check:
* whether it is possible to cause a denial of service condition by overflowing one or more data structures of the target application.
* that the application properly releases resources (files and/or memory) after they have been used.
* whether an attacker can lock valid user accounts by repeatedly attempting to log in with a wrong password.
* whether it is possible to exhaust server resources by making it allocate a very large number of objects.
* whether it is possible to allocate big amounts of data into a user session object in order to make the server exhaust its memory resources.
* whether it is possible to force the application to loop through a code segment that needs high computing resources, in order to decrease its overall performance</p>

<p>Stress testing exposes software systems to simulated cyber attacks, revealing potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities in their implementation. By using such testing, these internal weaknesses and vulnerabilities can be discovered earlier in the software development life cycle, corrected prior to deployment, and lead to improved software quality. Overall denial of service tests should be complemented with security stress tests to perform actions or create conditions which cause delays, disruptions, or failures of the application under test.</p>
