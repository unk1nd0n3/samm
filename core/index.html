Although these functions are not performed directly by an application, the overall security of the application and its data is dependent on their proper performance. All of the protections built into an application can be rendered irrelevant by deploying the application on an unsupported operating system with unpatched vulnerabilities, or failing to store backup media securely....</p>

      <p>OWASP is an international organization and the OWASP Foundation supports OWASP efforts around the world. OWASP is an open community dedicated to enabling organizations to conceive, develop, acquire, operate, and maintain applications that can be trusted. All of the OWASP tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. We advocate approaching application security as a people, process, and technology problem because the most effective approaches to application security include improvements in all of these areas.
