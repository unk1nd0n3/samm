      <description>Proposed Overview The Policy &amp;amp; Compliance (PC) Practice is focused on understanding and meeting external legal and regulatory requirements while also driving internal security standards to ensure compliance in a way thatâ€™s aligned with the business purpose of the organization.
A driving theme for improvement within this Practice is focused on describing organization&amp;rsquo;s standards and 3rd party obligations as application requirements, enabling efficient and automated audits that may be leveraged within the SDLC and continuously demonstrate that all expectations are being met.</description>

With improved access to information, project teams will be better able to proactively identify and mitigate the specific security risks that apply to their organization.
One major theme for improvement across the Objectives is providing training for employees, either through instructor-led sessions or computer-based modules.</description>
