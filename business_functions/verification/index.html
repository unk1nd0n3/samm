Identify application and infrastructure architecture components Ad-hoc review of the architecture against compliance requirement   Maturity 2 - Review the complete provision of security mechanisms in the architecture Are the architecture security mechanisms well implemented Analyze the architecture against known security requirements and best practices   Maturity 3 - Review the architecture effectiveness and feedback results to improve the security architecture Review of the architecture components effectiveness Feedback the architecture review results into the enterprise architecture, organisation design principles &amp; patterns, security solutions and reference architectures    Original Overview     A: Application Architecture B: Supporting Architecture     Maturity 1 - Support ad-hoc reviews of software design to ensure baseline mitigations for known risks....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Overview     A: Control Verification B: Misuse/Abuse Testing     Maturity 1 - Opportunistically find basic vulnerabilities and other security issues. Test for standard security controls Perform security fuzzing testing   Maturity 2 - Perform implementation review to discover application-specific risks against the security requirements. Derive test cases from known security requirements Create and test abuse cases and business logic flaw test   Maturity 3 - Maintain the application security level after bug fixes, changes or during maintenance Perform regression testing (with security unit tests) Denial of service and security stress testing    Overview A: Control Verification &lt;!...</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Overview     A: Scalable Baseline B: Deep Understanding     Maturity 1 - Perform security testing (both manual and tool based) to discover security defects. Utilize automated security testing tools Perform manual security testing of high-risk components   Maturity 2 - Make security testing during development more complete and efficient through automation complemented with regular manual security penetration tests Employ application-specific security testing automation Conduct manual penetration testing   Maturity 3 - Embed security testing as part of the development and deployment processes....</p>

      <p>OWASP is an international organization and the OWASP Foundation supports OWASP efforts around the world. OWASP is an open community dedicated to enabling organizations to conceive, develop, acquire, operate, and maintain applications that can be trusted. All of the OWASP tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. We advocate approaching application security as a people, process, and technology problem because the most effective approaches to application security include improvements in all of these areas.
